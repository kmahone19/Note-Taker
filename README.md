## Discription

  The Note taker app is as simple as it sounds. Once you click to get started you are given two fields, one for the title and one for the notes, both fields are required to submit a new note. Once submitted, all past notes are displayed at the bottom of the page and can be deleted at any time with the click of a button. The best part of the Note taker app is it allows you to access all notes store in the data base from anywhere, so you can add and delete notes as you need.
